        <h3 style="text-align:left;">Software as a service (SaaS):</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Salesforce_logo.svg/1200px-Salesforce_logo.svg.png" style="float:left;width:100px;height:100px;">
            Software as a service (SaaS; pronounced /s√¶s/[1]) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.[2][3]
            It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software",[4] and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft.[5] SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.
            SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, including office software, messaging software, payroll processing software, DBMS software, management software, CAD software, development software,
            gamification, virtualization,[4] accounting, collaboration, customer relationship management (CRM), Management Information Systems (MIS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), invoicing, human resource management (HRM),
            talent acquisition, learning management systems, content management (CM), and service desk management.[6] SaaS has been incorporated into the strategy of nearly all leading enterprise software companies.[citation needed][7][8]

        <h3 style="text-align:left;">Platform as a service (PaaS):</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="https://static.c9.io/nc-3.1.4109-2ffb85e2-wf/static/plugins/c9.profile/static/images/cloud9-logo.svg" style="float:left;width:100px;height:100px;">
            Platform as a Service (PaaS) or application platform as a Service (aPaaS) or platform base service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, 
            and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.[1][2][3] PaaS can be delivered in three ways: 
            as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS), 
            middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.), database and other services to host the consumer's application; as a private service (software or appliance) inside the firewall; or as software 
            deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.

        <h3 style="text-align:left;">Infrastructure as a service(IaaS):</h3>
        <p>

            Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, 
            location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors
            within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions
            of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware. Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers. Containerisation offers 
            higher performance than virtualization, because there is no hypervisor overhead. Also, container capacity auto-scales dynamically with computing load, which eliminates the problem of over-provisioning and enables usage-based billing.[1]
            IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks (VLANs), and software bundles.

        <h3 style="text-align:left;">Communication as a service(CaaS):</h3>
        <p>

            Unified communications as a service (UCaaS) is a category of "as a service" or "cloud" delivery mechanisms for enterprise communications. Similar to platform as a service (PaaS, where data center capacity is made available to an 
            enterprise on a consumption model from a service provider), with UCaaS, unified communications services can be made available from the cloud to enterprises.
            UCaaS is part of a global industry trend towards cloud services.
